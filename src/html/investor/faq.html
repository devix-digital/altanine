								<p>Metformin is the most common drug used and is the first-line agent in type 2 diabetes management. It is also considered one of the safest pharmacological agents for the treatment of the disease.</p>
								<p>However, gastrointestinal side effects are common, occurring in up to 75% of those who take metformin (2). These side effects may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and/or flatulence, with severity ranging from mild to severe. These complications are more common with immediate-release preparations of metformin than with its extended-release formulation. Discontinuation and nonadherence rates have been as high as 46% with metformin because of these issues (3).</p>
