					<h4>Worldwide, more than half a billion people have diabetes.</h4>
					<b>
						In the U.S., <i>it’s more than 37 million — and 9 out of 10 have type 2 diabetes,</i> a complex disease where the body doesn’t use energy from food properly.
					</b>
					<p>
						Despite the many treatment advancements in recent years, only half of the people living with diabetes are meeting goals for lowering their blood glucose levels.
					</p>
					<p>
						When glucose is not properly managed, it may lead to serious complications, including kidney disease, nerve damage, heart attack and stroke.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Diabetes is accelerating at an alarming rate globally. Today, over 475 million people across all age groups and social classes, live with the chronic condition. What is even more worrying is the fact that this mostly goes undetected until it reaches life-threatening proportions. The needs of people with type 2 diabetes continue to evolve over time, and treatment approaches need to reflect that.
					</p>
					<b>Our innovative products repurpose a traditional and effective diabetes therapy allowing patients to increase compliance without suffering side effects or related difficulties with swallowing large pills.</b>
