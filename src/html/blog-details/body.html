					<h4>Wegovy is now available in the UK</h4>
					<p>In September 2023, Novo Nordisk announced that a limited supply of Wegovy would soon begin to reach many people living with obesity including some people with type 2 diabetes, or at risk of type 2 diabetes, through a ‘controlled and limited launch’.
					</p>
					<p>Wegovy will become available to people in specialist NHS weight management services who meet the NICE eligibility criteria, or privately through a registered healthcare professional. People who are prescribed Wegovy within these specialist NHS services will also receive support with dietary advice and exercise.</p>

					<h3>They understand that the Chapter 11 process can be intricate and demanding</h3>
					<p>Wegovy cannot yet be prescribed outside of specialist weight management services, but in June 2023 the Department of Health announced a two-year pilot to tackle obesity, which will explore how Wegovy can be prescribed outside of these services, which are largely hospital based.</p>
					<p>The government says the NICE recommendations mean that around 35,000 people will have access to Wegovy, but to make it available to more people who could be eligible, the pilot will explore how GPs could safely offer Wegovy, and how the NHS can provide support in the community or digitally. These pilots are still in development and not yet up and running. Currently, Wegovy, Saxenda and Orlistat are the only medications that are licensed and approved for weight loss in the UK. Unfortunately, with no Tier 3 weight management services in operation in Northern Ireland, Wegovy is currently unable to be prescribed through the health service.</p>
